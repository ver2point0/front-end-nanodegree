# Establishing a Web Developer Mindset

## 1. Dear future self

### How will you solve your problems?
Future self, the following suggestions are what I recommend to solve the problems you will encouner:
1. Reread the problem as many times as needed to understand it.
2. Break the problems down into smaller, manageable parts to achieve the bigger picture.
3. Draw pictures related to the problem.
4. Implement the Read-Search-Ask (RSA) method, Google it if you don't know it.

### What skills do you have now that will help you tackle your challenges?
Future self, you have patience and grit. Everyone learns how to program in their own time as long as they put in the effort.
Fortunately, you have experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You know how to find help when you need it. 
Remember, done is better than perfection. Ship what you have now and refine it later.

### How will what youâ€™ve learned about having a growth mindset help you reach your goals?
Having a growth mindset means I will find a way to figure out different ways to reach my goals. 
One of the best ways is to ask for help because someone else has probably faced the same problem.

## 2. Developer goals

### Personal goals
My personal goals for the FEND are to complete all of my projects on time or early 
and learn as much as I can to build better front-end experiences.
